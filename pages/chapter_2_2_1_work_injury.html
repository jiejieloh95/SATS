                <p>When you are evaluating whether an employee’s medical condition has resulted from a work-related incident, you need to take into consideration his job duties and working environment.  Assess whether a work event or exposure to the employee’s working environment has caused or contributed to his medical condition or significantly aggravated an existing injury or medical condition.</p>
                <p>The exceptions are:</p>
                <p>• The medical condition involves signs or symptoms that surfaced at work but resulted solely from a non-work-related event or exposure. <br>
                • The medical condition resulted solely from voluntary participation in a non-work related activity.</p>
                <p>You must obtain medical advice from the employee’s doctor-in-charge on whether there is a likelihood that his work duties and work environment had contributed to his medical condition or significantly aggravated an existing injury or illness.</p>
